    // --- Inventory item row ---------------------------------------------------

    // (held: x10), Enter types an exact one, Del / X removes the item. When
    // `locked` is true the amount still shows but nothing edits it.
    //
    // Removal is confirmed by a SECOND Del / X, so the first press only arms
    // the row and says so; arming lapses on its own after a couple of seconds.

    // it was - so the confirmation stays.)

    // in-progress typing on the value's own address, but the inventory snapshot
    // is rebuilt every ~120ms, so item rows have no such stable pointer. Build
    // `key` from whatever addresses the item (storage, category, position,
    // type) and it does better than a pointer would: if the row's item changes
    // under an edit, the key changes with it and the edit is dropped instead of
    // landing on whatever moved in.

    // --- Color swatch row -------------------------------------------------------
    // A row of up to 12 circular color buttons (the dye editor's preset
    // palette). Left/Right move the focus ring along the row and the mouse
    // takes it wherever it points; Enter / A / click picks the focused
    // swatch. `rgb` packs one color per swatch as 0xRRGGBB.
    //
    // `cursor` is the row's remembered focus column (clamped into range) -
    // give each row its own int so the ring stays put across frames.
    // `current`, when 0..count-1, draws a dot on that swatch: "this is the
    // color the zone wears right now".
    //
    // With a non-empty `label` the swatches sit right-aligned like any value
    // column (a one-swatch row makes a labelled "apply this color" button);
    // with an empty label they start at the left inset, so consecutive rows
    // stack into a grid.
    //
    // `clearIndex`, when 0..count-1, draws that swatch as a "remove / none"
    // marker (a slashed disc) instead of a color - its `rgb` entry is ignored.

    // clear rather than apply.

    // --- Catalog "add this item" row ------------------------------------------

    // amount layout, same Left/Right stepping (held: x10). What differs is what
    // the row is FOR - an item you do not own yet:
    //   * the amount is how many to ADD, not a quantity to overwrite, so it
    //     starts at 1 rather than being read from anything;
    //   * Enter / A ADDS. It does not start inline typing the way ItemRow does,
    //     because here the amount is the input and adding is the action;
    //   * there is nothing to remove.
    // For a large amount, add one and set the exact quantity in the Editor -
    // that is what the quantity editor is for, and it beats holding Right.
    //
    // The amount lives in the widget, keyed by `key`, and resets to 1 when you
    // move to another row: each row is its own "add this many of this", and a
    // count left over from the last item is a trap, not a convenience.
    //

    // --- Keybind rows ---------------------------------------------------------
    // One action bound to a keyboard key AND a controller button, shown on a
    // single row as two side-by-side columns so the two devices read as
    // separate, paired choices rather than a flat list of "<action> Key" /
    // "<action> Button" rows.
    //
    // Left/Right move the focus between the Keyboard and Controller column;
    // Enter / A / click asks to rebind the focused column; Del / X asks to
    // reset it. `cursor` is the caller-owned focus column (0 = keyboard,
    // 1 = controller) so the highlight stays put across frames - give each row
    // its own int. `keyText` / `padText` are the current bind displays the
    // caller formats (pass "press a key..." / "press a button..." yourself for
    // whichever column is mid-capture, named by `capturingCol`: 0, 1, or -1 for
    // none, which also pulses that column so it reads as "listening").

    // and "reset" actually do (start a capture, restore a default...).
