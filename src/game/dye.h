    // Armor dye / material / repair-condition editor - the dyehouse, from the
    // menu, for whatever is currently equipped. See the dye section of
    // offsets.h for the full RE background; the short version:
    //
    //  - Dye state is 16-byte records ON the item value (color group, RGB,
    //    material template, repair/weathering byte, keyed by a 0..11 channel =
    //    one colorable zone of the mesh).
    //  - We apply through the client's own dye-ack handler - the exact code
    //    the dyehouse transaction drives - so records land in the equipped
    //    entry AND the rendered materials update live, no re-equip needed.
    //    Unlike the dyehouse there is no palette restriction: any RGB works.
    //  - The equipped entry is the render source but not the durable copy, so
    //    the same records are mirrored into the item value in the inventory
    //    holders (both realms, matched by instance id) with the engine's own
    //    upsert - that is the state the dyehouse itself persists.
    //
    // The equip component is captured from the game's own player-equip batch
    // function, which fires during load-in dress-up and on every gear change.
