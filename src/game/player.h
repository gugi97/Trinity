    // How it works, and why it survives game updates (everything is located by
    // byte signature, never a baked address):
    //  - Crimson Desert is a three-protagonist game (Kliff plus two companions,
    //    all controllable/summonable and able to coexist), so RefreshSelf()
    //    resolves the whole PLAYER SET fresh every game tick from the engine's
    //    gameplay-character manager (kCharMgrAnchors): the manager owns a
    //    vector of every character and we collect each one whose class tag is
    //    player (SelfPlayer / OtherPlayer). From each we walk to its stat entries
    //    and battle-damage identity and cache just those. Because the resolve is
    //    fresh, a body transition (mount / transform / character swap) that
    //    reallocates a character is picked up on the next tick - there is no
    //    stale-pointer cache to churn. The movement-update tick drives the
    //    refresh on the game thread.
    //  - We hook the engine's single stat-commit funnel (every HP/Stamina/
    //    Spirit write - damage, drain, heal, regen - passes through it) and,
    //    for whichever tracked-player entry a toggle applies to, force current
    //    back to full right after each write. Because that happens inside the
    //    commit call - before any death check up the stack can read the
    //    lowered value - HP never registers at a lethal value, so fall
    //    damage and one-shots can't kill; and because it fires on every
    //    write instead of polling, Stamina/Spirit never need a per-frame
    //    pin either. Every read/write is guarded, so a stale pointer after a
    //    reload is dropped rather than crashing.

        // character is picked up here. Must run on the game thread; the
